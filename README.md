# BasicAI
 
the commented out part in source.cpp is my original non OOP version of my AI. 
after that i made the AI into an object which simplified programming. i also incorporated the GLM library to simplify the maths. 
after getting that to work i added in a fourth input which was always set to 1 which acted as a bias for the single layer network
